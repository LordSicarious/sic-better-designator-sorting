	<description>Divides up some overcrowded designator categories in the Architect menu, shifts some items around, and improves ordering across the board. Major changes include:
- Rest category, containing all beds and their related facilities, including Deathrest Caskets, as well as Cryptosleep Caskets.
- Science category, containing Research benches and their facilities, mineral scanners, Biotech genetics buildings, and various science-y buildings.
- Technology category, containing miscellaneous high tech devices like the Comms Console, Ship or Orbitral Trade Beacons, Biosculpter Pods, and Mechanitor infrastructure.
- The Ideology and Biotech tabs are removed, with their contents spread out across many other tabs.
